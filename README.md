# Availability-of-American-Rehabilitation-Programs-An-Econometric-Research-Study

This is an econometric research project I completed for as a senior at LSU in 2018.

Synopsis:

In this econometric research project, I aim to investigate the influence of macroeconomic factors and political leadership on the 
availability of rehabilitation programs in American public prisons. The study addresses the urgent need to reduce recidivism rates and 
improve the criminal justice system by examining the factors that hinder some facilities from providing sufficient rehabilitation 
opportunities to prisoners preparing for life after release.

The research emphasizes that many prisons wish to offer rehabilitation programs, but lack the necessary funding, given the increasing costs of running correctional facilities in the United States. The economic and social costs of inadequate rehabilitation are significant, with a high rate of re-arrests and lost labor contributing to financial burdens on taxpayers and society.

The research project addresses data from all 50 states in the United States, covering a total of 1,821 adult correctional facilities, which includes prisons and federal institutions. The dataset comprises 1,821 observations, providing a comprehensive analysis of the factors influencing the availability of rehabilitation programs in American public prisons.

Data for this study comes from three main sources. First, I used the 2005 Census of State and Federal Adult Correctional Facilities, which includes responses from prisoners and relevant state-level data on the availability of rehabilitation programs within prisons. The second source of data includes pertinent state-level economic indicators, specifically Gross Domestic Product (GDP) per capita and the unemployment rate for each state during 2005.

GDP per capita data was obtained from official government sources, specifically the Bureau of Economic Analysis (BEA) or the United States Department of Commerce. Unemployment rates for each state were sourced from the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS), specifically from the "Economy at a Glance" tables.

The econometric approach employs the probit model to analyze the relationship between GDP per capita, unemployment rates, and democratic governor leadership with the availability of rehabilitation programs. To test the hypotheses, I generate an indicator-dependent variable called "any_program" that assesses the collective impact of these factors on rehabilitation availability.

The results reveal several significant findings. 

First, higher GDP per capita is positively associated with the probability of offering alcohol, medical, mental health, education, and drug treatment programs, indicating that states with better economic performance are more likely to invest in rehabilitation ventures. 

Second, the relationship between unemployment rates and program availability is counterintuitive, showing a positive correlation with alcohol and drug treatment programs but a negative correlation with medical programs. This finding may reflect the political economy of crime control and resource allocation. 

Third, Democratic governor leadership is positively associated with alcohol, medical, and drug treatment programs, while vocational training programs are solely affected by GDP per capita, and college programs depend exclusively on the governor's political affiliation.

However, the model does have certain limitations that should be acknowledged. Firstly, the study relies on cross-sectional data, which only provides a snapshot of the relationships at a specific point in time. Longitudinal data over multiple years would be ideal to capture the dynamic changes in rehabilitation program availability and its relationship with economic and political factors.

Secondly, the study's focus on state-level data might overlook significant variations within states or regional differences that could influence rehabilitation program availability. Different local policies, budgetary constraints, and community needs might play a role that cannot be fully captured at the state level.

Thirdly, while the probit model is appropriate for binary outcomes, it may not account for all potential confounding factors or unobservable variables that could influence the results. There could be other factors not included in the model that affect rehabilitation program availability.

Lastly, the study uses data from 2005, and circumstances may have changed since then. Economic conditions, political leadership, and criminal justice policies may have evolved, impacting the availability of rehabilitation programs differently in subsequent years.

In conclusion, this research sheds light on the factors influencing the availability of rehabilitation programs in American public prisons. Despite its limitations, the study provides valuable insights for policymakers and advocates seeking to enhance rehabilitation efforts and reduce recidivism rates. 

The findings emphasize the importance of economic growth, effective resource allocation, and the role of political leadership in promoting successful reentry into society for inmates. Further research using more recent and comprehensive data could provide a more nuanced understanding of the complex relationships between macroeconomic factors, political leadership, and the availability of rehabilitation programs in public prisons.
